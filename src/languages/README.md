# How to translate

1. Fork this repo.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run update-language-files --language=<code>` where `<code>`
   is a valid ISO language code:
   http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm. You can also use
   this command to check if there are new strings to
   translate for your language.
4. Your language file should be filled in. You can translate now.
5. Add it into `languageList` constant.
6. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/pulls) when you have done.

If you do not have programming skills, let me know in [the issues section](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues). I will assist you. 😏
